<p>I am a Computer Scientist who is currently working with H3ABioNet as a Data Manager
to solve the many challenges of submitting Terabytes and Petabytes of genomic data to
the European Genome Archive. My interests are using Deep Learning and
Artifical Intelligence on Big Data to solve global unique problems that can improve
the lives of millions of people.</p>

<p>I use the Python programming tools on a daily basis. I also teach and train other
people to use Python, Linux and Github. The other topics I teach are FAIR Data and
Open Licenses. I give talks at online webinars as well as meetings, conferences and
workshops. In my spare time, I cycle and hike. I also like to travel.</p>
