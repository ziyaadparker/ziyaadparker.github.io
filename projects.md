A hand-picked selection of projects, businesses and experiments I’ve designed, developed, succeeded, failed and learned with.

<h2>Businesses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Freelance Consulting</strong>: Developing websites, mobile and desktop applications. Data analysis and programming scripts to execute mundane tasks. Some of the code is found on my Github profile. The technologies used are varied according to the use cases. If it is a content management website I would use Wordpress or static html depending on the budget. If it is data analysis or machine learning I would use Python.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>WizCreator</strong>: This was a Whiteboard Animation business that started out as a hobby while I was final year in my Computer Science degree.
    I managed the people responsible for graphics, voice overs and script writing. Most of them were in remote locations. I was also responsible for producing and making sure the videos were completed on time and in the right budget constraints. I call this venture successful because we managed to produced videos for some large corporate clients such as Sanlam and Nedbank as well as government clients in India, Papa New Guinea, Kenya and other countries.  
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ethereum Web App</strong>:
    As the rise of cryptocurrencies and more investors buying into Ethereum due to ICO’s and other investment factors. The rise of hacking that takes place with Bitcoin was also increasing. An Ethereum Web App was built to help investors avoid their Ethereum getting hacked and stolen. All compromised private keys are stored in this database.
    There are two parts to this project:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/ziyaadparker/eth-secure">Code</a> that generates the keys - Using the algorithm created by the founder in the Ethereum whitepaper, I generated all the possible private keys for the Ethereum cryptocurrency.</li>
      <li>Web Interface for user to search the database (built using the Django Framework) - If the private key has been found in the database then the user should not be using it. This is a red flag.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eating Smooth Blog</strong>: Blog about smoothies using Wordpress content management software.
    Discontinued to lack of time and experience with creating content.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>MotorWorld</strong>: Online classifieds for buying and selling cars. Discontinued due to lack of experience with the industry. Car sellers
    were not interested because of the low number of car buyers. In order to get buyers there had to be sellers and in order to have sellers there had to be buyers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hospitality Careers</strong>: Recruitment job portal for the hospitality industry. Few people have found jobs through this portal and I am glad for them.
    Discontinued due to lack of experience with the industry. It needed a higher number of users on the system before I could start selling advertising space for recruiters. </p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Artificial Intelligence Engineering</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>BunaGrind</strong>: Orders coffee from any coffee shop registered on the system. Provides users with intelligent visualization and personalized recommendations. Gives users insights into purchase history with various detailed graphs. Gives a recommendation based on weather, purchase history and what similar customers have purchased. Currently building a robotic hand to make coffee better than a barista. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ganscape</strong>: Engineered a robotic hand to paint like an artist. Still in the infancy stages as it does abstract paintings presently. Contains Deep Learning algorithms such as neural networks to classify images and paint accordingly. Also uses generative vector art as layers for the artwork. The first stages were to convert photos into paintings that look like it was painted by famous artists. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>CoinScout</strong>: Bitcoin trading bot that uses Deep Learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks to predict the price of bitcoin and other alternative coins. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mobile Game Development</h2>
Been removed from the Google Play Store due to lack of time to maintain it. All of it was done on Android.
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ape Theory</strong>: An ape who does not have skills to cut ropes needs to get bananas that are hanging on ropes from the trees. The good part is
    that he can climb trees. The player has to play with the ape to get the bananas by cutting the ropes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Magic Tortoise</strong>: Inspiration from the famous Flappy Bird and <a href="https://github.com/cubei/FlappyCow">Flappy Cow</a>. The player plays with a magical
    flying tortoise that must fly between silver pipes without hitting them. Once the player hits a pipe, the player dies and restarts. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pear Snap</strong>: Player plays as a pear, the pear need needs to jump as high as possible by tilting the mobile device. The game has bombs, coins, trampolines and more.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Web Application Development</h2>
Some notable web applications that I worked on.
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LegalJobPortal</strong>:
    Client in the legal industry needed a portal where legal firms can list job vacancies and where job seekers can upload their CV’s. The problem arose when there was no
    single website that contained job postings about the legal industry. Job seekers had to search multiple legal firm websites to find a reasonable job listing.
    I developed a complex system that allowed for the ease of use for legal firm recruiters and job seekers.
    <ul>
      <li>CV database – An area where job seekers can list their educations, experience and skills.</li>
      <li>Complex Searching – The job recruiter can search the database based on skills, experience and education.</li>
      <li>Portal – Separate portal for both the job seeker and legal firm recruiter.</li>
      <li>Apply functionality – Every job listing had an apply button where the job seeker could instantly upload their Cover Letter and CV. The documents would go directly to the legal firm.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Spreeline Motors</strong>:
    Client in the motor industry needed a website to advertise the cars needed to be sold. The problem started when client was advertising cars in the classifieds section of
    local newspapers for a very long time. Application for finance was done manually on paper. It needed to be signed and taken to the office. Customers had to phone in to find
    out more details about the specific car. Society is in the information age and in order to increase sales by saving time, client needed to have a web presence and move
    to online marketing. The application for finance is now done automatically.
    <ul>
      <li>Slide show to display the various cars on the home page.</li>
      <li>Simple dashboard for entering details and uploading images for the car. Details include make, model, year, mileage, price and short description about the car.</li>
      <li>Complex Search Engine – allows users to search and filter for cars by Year, Price, Make and Model in the gallery.</li>
      <li>Online Application to apply for Finance</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Prediction Market - Wisdom of the Crowds</strong>:
    Client in the financial services industry always used manual ways of gathering data that included online polls and surveys. There were group meetings to capture insights
    from members in the team which was not effective in terms of calculating the probabilities as well as having it done in an automated way.
    The prediction market is used for the purpose of making predictions based on perceptions. The completion of the system included a portal where users can login anonymously
    and give feedback. The data gathered would be used for querying, data mining, analytical processing and reporting.
    <ul>
      <li>Providing immediate aggregated information,</li>
      <li>Assessing and understanding changes in perceptions within the business,</li>
      <li>Anonymity, thus providing the business to counter the risk of group think,</li>
      <li>Assists in identifying business risks early,</li>
      <li>Provide valuable feedback for strategic managers from the data visualization</li>
      <li>Tapping into “wisdom of the crowds or experts”,</li>
      <li>Provides predictive analysis,</li>
      <li>Live aggregated feedback system.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    The mobile component is to allow people in a boardroom to answer anonymously via the system to receive live feedback. The
    problem came about when questions were posed in a meeting, and some people were dishonest in their responses. The solution was using a mobile application where a user gets
    asked a question and the answer saved anonymously.

    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Food Take Aways Website</strong>:
    Client in the FMCG / Retail and Fast Foods industry opened up a new store in a busy area. The store was located on the side of a bridge. This meant that people in cars
    driving past could see the Fast Foods store but could not see the prices. Customers phoning the store and asking for prices is quite a tedious process.
    The only way for people to see the prices would be to build an e-commerce website. A website that is viewable on all devices from computers, tablets and mobile phones. When
    people drive past they can now quickly access their mobile devices, view prices and then place an order.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Refugee Website</strong>: As part of giving back to the community I created a website to help refugees (from Congo) that are living in Cape Town. A
    current problem existed that one group of refugees could not find another group of refugees residing in the same area.
    I created a very simple website that included an About page, Contact page with address and Google Maps integration, gallery of the refugee camp and an online application
    form for other refugees to find and join. The main aim of the website is for refugees to find other refugees. I SEO optimized the website for easy finding on Google.</p>
